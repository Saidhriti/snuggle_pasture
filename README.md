In "Snuggle Pasture", you play as a city-dweller who has just moved to a small town. Upon arrival, you are gifted a free cow to keep as a pet. Your goal is to care for your cow and explore your new surroundings.

As you discover the shops in town, you can interact with the owners, buy clothes for your character, and even purchase potions to care for your pet cow. To earn the local currency, called "dabloons," you can work at a local florist as their accountant, pocketing a handsome salary.

The goal of the game is to buy all the available items from each shop! 

A relaxing, point-and-click gameplay style, "Snuggle Pasture" is a heartwarming experience that will have you falling in love with your pet cow and the quaint town you now call home.
