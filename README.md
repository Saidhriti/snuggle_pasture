In "Snuggle Pasture", you play as a city-dweller who has just moved to a small town. Upon arrival, you are gifted a free cow to keep as a pet. Your goal is to get to friendship level 5 with your cow.

As you discover the shops in town, you can interact with the owners, buy clothes for your character, and even purchase potions to care for your pet cow. To earn the local currency, called "dabloons," you can work at a local florist as their accountant, pocketing a handsome salary. 

ASCII art is used to help visualise the various locations.

A relaxing python text-based game, "Snuggle Pasture" is a heartwarming experience that will have you falling in love with your pet cow and the quaint town you now call home.
